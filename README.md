# Overall

This code contains three main projects Client, Map Editor and Particle Editor. Those are using a library created by me called 'JicLib' which is in charge of all Dx11 rendering stuff.

Furthermore, this project contains a basic c++ networking server, which is using a non relational database to store entities.
